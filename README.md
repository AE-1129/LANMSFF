# LANMSFF
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variations have shown effectiveness in facial expression recognition (FER); However, they face challenges when dealing with high computational complexity and poor performance on multi-view head poses in real-world scenarios. We introduce a lightweight attentional network incorporating multi-scale feature fusion (LANMSFF) to tackle these issues. For the first challenge, we have carefully designed a lightweight fully convolutional network (FCN). We present two novel components, namely mass attention (MassAtt) and point wise feature selection (PWFS) blocks, in order to tackle the second challenge. The MassAtt block simultaneously generates channel and spatial attention maps to recalibrate feature maps by emphasizing important features while suppressing irrelevant ones. On the other hand, the PWFS block employs a feature selection mechanism to discard less meaningful features prior to the fusion process distinguishing itself from previous methods that directly fuse multi-scale features. Our proposed approach achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art methods in terms of parameter counts and robustness to pose variation, with accuracy rates of 90.77% on KDEF, 70.44% on FER-2013, and 86.96% on FERPlus datasets.
